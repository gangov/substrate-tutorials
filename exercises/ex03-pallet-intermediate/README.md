# Intermediate pallet: Non-fungible tokens

In this tutorial, you will build a simple NFT pallet.

## What to do?

Edit the code in ```ex03-nft/nft/src/lib.rs``` until all tests pass. This time there are no more 
already filled extrinsic and neither detailed instructions. You will have to figure out what to 
code yourself!

## What to focus on?

First, you are building an NFT pallet. That's nice! There is tons of activity, projects, and money 
about NFT, and you are learning how to code those.

About the actual coding, it's just a second round to make sure you really mastered the core of 
Substrate pallets. Once this is done, we will start to explore some more hairy features of the 
framework. Good luck!
